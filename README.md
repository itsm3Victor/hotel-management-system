cbse project implementation

- Aware to the port number of the database
The port number can be change at the application.properties file

- All of the class GUI is copy pasted from the original project, thus some of the file name and naming convention may be a lot messy.
One of the example is CustomerRestaurant java class file showing the CustomerRoom logic and vice versa.

- Only the business logic is modified into services and repository, and added the Entity part (Still progressing on it). And the modified parts are commented out.
